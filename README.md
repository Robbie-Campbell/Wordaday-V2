## Okay this is a bit of a messy one, i made it six months ago but i have come back to it now i know a bit more and added some cool new features

- This is a web scraping application that can return various data from different websites
- There are some silly things included
- It is being used in a couple of servers

# FEATURE LIST

### The cool stuff
1. Define and teach new words (the original function)
2. Returns a random shakespearean insult
3. Dice rolls for D and D
4. Binary, hexidecimal, octal and decimal conversion
5. Rock name Guessing game
6. Return a random inspirational quote
7. Return a random fact

### The boring stuff
1. Sends a few memey GIFS (This was an early feature, not particularly helpful)
2. Gives version info and my author info
3. A pretty bad ping test

## :shipit: Not much else to say with this one, other than enjoy! :shipit:
